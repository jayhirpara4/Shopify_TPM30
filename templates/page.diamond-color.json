Although the sparkle of the diamond is induced more by its cut, for color grades (D-F) these allow a lot more light to come in without obstruction enhancing brilliance.<\/p>"}},"faq_fcy4dk":{"type":"faq","settings":{"question":"Can the setting impact how the diamond color appears?","answer":"<p>For sure, yes!<\/p><ul><li>The use of white gold or platinum enhances the clarity of D-F grade diamonds.<\/li><li>The use of yellow or rose gold may enhance the color grade of the faint colors (G-M) into colorless appearance.<\/li><\/ul>"}},"faq_tEyVAp":{"type":"faq","settings":{"question":"What is the difference between a D-color and G-color diamond?","answer":"<ul><li>D-Color diamonds are the most colorless diamonds in the diamond family, those which are found and sold in smaller quantities.<\/li><li>G-color diamonds are therefore just graded in the same level with g and f color diamonds where the faint hue can only be detected by a gemologist. However, to the normal person who does not have specialized training, their difference is almost none, which makes g so common and inexpensive.<\/li><\/ul>"}},"faq_hbwHEG":{"type":"faq","settings":{"question":"Are diamonds with lower color grades less valuable?","answer":"<p>Lower color grades (K-Z) are of lower cost but not implying the “less value” attached to them depends on your preference and the environment. For instance, a k grade diamond placed in yellow gold will look beautiful since it is a warm tone.<\/p>"}},"faq_3tER7x":{"type":"faq","settings":{"question":"Should I prioritize color over cut or clarity?","answer":"<p>That is up to you, what are your priorities? There is a cut for maximum brilliance which is the most significant. If sparkle is all that matters thus cut is cut first then color and clarity.<\/p>"}},"faq_z9nrRp":{"type":"faq","settings":{"question":"What is the most popular diamond color grade?","answer":"<p>The most commonly chosen colors are G-H grade diamonds as they present a near colorless appearance which makes them economically feasible but with high brilliance.<\/p>"}},"faq_L78mke":{"type":"faq","settings":{"question":"Do fancy-colored diamonds follow the same color grading scale?","answer":"<p>Fancy colored diamonds (pink, blue, or yellow) in particular, are graded completely differently. Their worth depends on how intense and saturated the colors are rather than the absence of colors!<\/p>"}},"faq_wiWPEN":{"type":"faq","settings":{"question":"How can I see the true color of a diamond before buying?","answer":"<p>Colors of diamonds should be examined in daylight or any appropriate light source.
