A carat is equivalent to 0.2gm or 100 points. Although carat weight plays a role in the sizing of a diamond, it is also influenced by the cut and shape of the diamond.<\/p>"}},"faq_FUTJf6":{"type":"faq","settings":{"question":"Does a higher carat weight mean a better diamond?","answer":"<p>Not really. Even though most people consider carat-weighted diamonds to be of higher value than other diamonds, the shape, or cut, and the color, and clarity of the diamonds are all vital components of a diamond’s beauty and splendor.<\/p>"}},"faq_BUKeVg":{"type":"faq","settings":{"question":"What is the most popular carat weight for engagement rings?","answer":"<p>For an average size woman, the most common carat weight selected for an engagement ring is usually within 0.75 carats to 1.5 carats range depending on individual taste and the state of finances.<\/p>"}},"faq_gKqf6T":{"type":"faq","settings":{"question":"How does carat weight affect price?","answer":"<p>Diamond prices increase exponentially with the carat weight due to economic reasons since larger diamonds are rarer. For instance, a 2 carat diamond stone will cost way more than 2 one-carat diamonds put together.<\/p>"}},"faq_U3BQFP":{"type":"faq","settings":{"question":"Does a larger carat diamond always look bigger?","answer":"<p>Not always. The way a diamond is cut and the diamond shape makes a lot of difference on how big it looks. For instance:<\/p><ul><li>A diamond that is cut well may appear bigger than one with the same weight but has been poorly cut.<\/li><li>The ovule, marquise, and pear shapes tend to look bigger than the round diamonds of the same weight.<\/li><\/ul>"}},"faq_tFC7fM":{"type":"faq","settings":{"question":"What’s the difference between carat weight and points?","answer":"<p>The carat weight is further divided into 100 points. For instance:<\/p><ul><li>1 carat = 100 points<\/li><li>0.50 carats = 50 points (half-carat diamond is also referred to this)<\/li><\/ul>"}},"faq_wVPEt4":{"type":"faq","settings":{"question":"How can I get a larger-looking diamond without increasing carat weight?","answer":"<ul><li>Select Super Grade Cuts of diamonds, because they have high sparkle and brilliance.<\/li><li>Prefer long shapes like oval, marquise and pear (instead of round).<\/li><li>Choose decorative settings such as halos or thinner bands to enhance the illusion of center stone size.<\/li><\/ul>"}},"faq_EwBbcA":{"type":"faq","settings":{"question":"Is it worth buying just under a full carat weight?","answer":"<p>Certainly, there is a financial incentive for purchasing diamonds with slightly lower weights than the popular weights of 0.90 carats or 1.90 carats. The difference in appearance is the same, however, as these diamonds look very close to a full carat diamond which one could not tell apart even a hundred percent close up.<\/p>"}},"faq_RKDUAh":{"type":"faq","settings":{"question":"Does carat weight affect how the diamond feels when worn?","answer":"<p>Comfort and weight are also affected as larger stones may, at times, feel weightier and hence, require stronger prongs. Consider how active you are when selecting the carat weight for the rings that will be on your hands every day.<\/p>"}},"faq_C8pMcg":{"type":"faq","settings":{"question":"Can I find smaller diamonds with excellent sparkle?","answer":"<p>Sure! The sparkle of a diamond is more attributed to the cut of a diamond than the weight of the diamond. The cut quality can even make small diamonds look beautiful and striking.<\/p>"}}},"block_order":["faq_HzgCd3","faq_FUTJf6","faq_BUKeVg","faq_gKqf6T","faq_U3BQFP","faq_tFC7fM","faq_wVPEt4","faq_EwBbcA","faq_RKDUAh","faq_C8pMcg"],"settings":{"heading":"FAQ's","subheading":""}},"shogun-optimizer":{"type":"shogun-optimizer","disabled":true,"settings":{}}},"order":["shogun-helper","main","carat_weight_MMGHU3","faqs_p8KCGU","shogun-optimizer"]}
