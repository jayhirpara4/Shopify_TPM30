Most diamonds with this clarity VS2 and SI1 are usually eye clean.<\/p>"}},"faq_edCnqW":{"type":"faq","settings":{"question":"Does diamond clarity affect sparkle?","answer":"<p>Yes, but to a lesser extent, cut. The weight and position of large noticeable flaws can cause distortion of light and thus cause minimal sparkle. However most of the time the effect of clarity on shine is less than that of the cut of the diamond.<\/p>"}},"faq_tfAakt":{"type":"faq","settings":{"question":"What is the difference between VVS and VS clarity grades?","answer":"<p>VVS: Very very slight inclusion: inclusions are so tiny that they can hardly be seen even by a ten magnification lens.

Most inclusions are considered non-detrimental because they are too tiny to affect the beauty or endurance of the diamond.<\/p>"}},"faq_F3eBpe":{"type":"faq","settings":{"question":"Do larger diamonds need a higher clarity grade?","answer":"<p>In general, yes. As the quality of the diamonds increases in size, the blemishes become more apparent and so there is a need for a higher clarity grade to keep it clean to the eyes.<\/p>"}},"faq_nGBh3h":{"type":"faq","settings":{"question":"Are all inclusions visible to the naked eye?","answer":"<p>No, reviewed diamonds classified as VS2 and above have almost all their inclusions hidden without help.
