        <h2 class="heading text-start">What is Diamond Clarity?</h2>
        <div class="GuideHeading text-start">
            Diamond clarity is the degree to which the diamond is free from or clear of inclusions and blemishes. Inclusions are characteristics found inside any given stone while blemishes are imperfections found outside the stone. Such features are natural and generally happen while the diamond is being formed, and they are often microscopic.<br><br>
            
            The Gemological Institute of America (GIA) provides a scale of diamond clarity that allows customers to know the standard of the diamond that they are buying. It includes;
        </div><br>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>FL (Flawless):</strong> No inclusions or blemishes visible to the naked eye, even at 10x magnification.</li><br>

            <li><strong>IF (Internally Flawless):</strong> Free of internal inclusions, but with surface blemishes only.</li><br>
            
            <li><strong>VVS1, VVS2 (Very, Very Slightly Included):</strong> So well concealed that even at 10x difficulty can detect these inclusions.</li><br>

            <li><strong>VS1, VS2 (Very Slightly Included):</strong> Inclusions visible at 10x magnification but not to the naked eye.</li><br>

            <li><strong>SI1, SI2 (Slightly Included):</strong> Inclusions visible at 10x magnification and may be seen without magnification in some examples.</li><br>

            <li><strong>I1, I2, I3 (Included):</strong> Inclusions easily visible to the eye and affect beauty.</li>
        </ul>

                <div class="aboutDesc">
                    Clarity contributes to the beauty and light performance of a diamond. With less inclusions and blemishes more light is able to pass through that diamond resulting in greater brilliance. But some from some point of view inclusions are so tiny that they have no effect on the aesthetics of the diamond hence clarity is subjective and depends on value.
