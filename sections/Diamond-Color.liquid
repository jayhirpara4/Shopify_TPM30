        <h2 class="heading text-start">What Is a Diamond Color?</h2>
        <div class="GuideHeading text-start">Diamond’s color translates to the absence of color within the stone. The more color a diamond has, the less common and more expensive it becomes. The Gemological Institute of America (GIA) classifies and ranks the color of diamonds from D which is colorless to Z which is very light yellow or brownish.</div><br>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>D-F (Colorless):</strong> The highest grade that still has no color seen even using a 10X loupe. These types of diamonds are for those who want the best since they are the purest and the most brilliant.</li><br>

            <li><strong>G-J (Near Colorless):</strong> A hint of color may be discerned with the naked eye; however, these colored diamonds are almost colorless and represent exceptional value for money, hence a growing demand for them.</li><br>
            
            <li><strong>K-M (Faint Color):</strong> A touch of warmth in the diamond, which can sometimes be more flattering with antique or warmer yellow golds.</li><br>

            <li><strong>N-Z (Noticeable Color):</strong> Diamonds that show distinct amounts of colored yellow and brown colors and are meant for more inventive styles and settings.</li>

                <div class="aboutDesc">
                    The color of the diamonds affects its beauty as well as the price of the diamond. A diamond that is colorless refracts a lot of light which results in a brilliant shine around the diamond. Yet, depending on one’s taste and the arrangement he or she is in, a diamond with some few colors may add a certain degree of warmth and appeal that is pleasing to the eyes.

                        In the diamond range of 1 carat, why not consider a diamond that is near colorless with grade G-J, for it will be a compromise between beauty and cost, because the difference in how they look outwardly is hardly distinguished by the common average person in grade diamond.

                        Personal preference should be the main guiding principle. For example, some people love the clear ice quality of the D grade diamond while some quite enjoy the fabulous look of the low grade diamonds.
