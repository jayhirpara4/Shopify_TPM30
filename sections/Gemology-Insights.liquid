            The term gemology is defined as the scientific study of gemstones. This includes their chemical structure, optical characteristics as well as other physical attributes that make each such stone distinct. For example, instead of learners being taught how to simply tell that a given sapphire is of Canadian origin, at the mastery level such study involves exploring the factors that influence the grading and pricing of colored gemstones. This allows the learning not to be superficial.

            It is not a secret that the proper identification of the gemstones is one of the spheres of gemstone studies that is most widely exploited. That is done with the aid of various gem identification techniques including, but not limited to, visual observation, specific gravity tests, as well as high-tech equipment such as refractometers and spectrometers. It is often up to the gemology experts to tell which stone is real or fake when such stones appear nearly the same.

            An area of gemology that is currently becoming more and more popular is the difference between natural and laboratory grown gemstones. Both types can be said to have the same chemical and optical characteristics, however laboratory made gems are grown in a laboratory. In other words, they are cheaper and easier to produce. It is also very important to the consumers to know the difference in these types of stones when they want an environmentally friendly option or a regular stone.

            It is not just their look which makes a precious stone precious. There are other factors like optical characteristics of a stone (i.e. how it refracts light), and its mineral content that greatly affect the importance of a stone. There are many methods and specific techniques of gemology where the scientists study these features in order to determine the actual cost of the gem.

            In short, a gemologist's work involves an accurate determination, assessment, and grading of gemstones using expert knowledge and tools. A gemologist's specialized knowledge is also important in determining the difference between natural and synthetic stones, as well as measuring the quality of stones and recommending how and where they should be used. Gemologist training is ultimately rooted in mineralogy, crystallography, and gem identification, which is important in enabling a comprehensive assessment of gemstones.

            Myriam Robert and all gemologists depend on gemology tools to evaluate stones with accuracy. These include uses of microscopes, refractometers and spectrometers to study various features of gemstones including one’s refractive index, desirability, degree of hardness, defects and more. Changes in geological approaches have simplified the problems of distinguishing between natural and artificial stones, treated and untreated ones, as well as many other aspects of gemology.

            The Prospects Of Gemology. The development of gemology is a continuous process, because with the advancement of science, gemstone evaluation becomes more improved and faster. The progression of gemological technique development involves more advanced spectroscopy, more sophisticated laser systems, and the use of 3D imagery. This makes it possible for gemologists to look further than what was previously possible in a gem’s structure and source. These improvements contribute to the integrity of the gemstone trade, whilst at the same time, increase buyer’s trust in their purchases.
