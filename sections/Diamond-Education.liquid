                        A diamond certification is an attestation from a gemologist or gemological laboratory that has examined, graded, embossed or laser inscribed a diamond under parameters defined as the 4 Cs and other quality concerns. Trustworthy and recognition laboratories such as GIA (Gemological Institute of America) and AGS (American Gem Society) offer a certification that plays a fundamental role in assuring the quality of the diamond, which a person desires to buy. The diamond certification reports inclusion weight, clarity, color, cut and other features of the diamond.

                        <li><strong>Importance of Certification:</strong> A diamond certification may be a mandatory requirement when purchasing a diamond as an assurance that the diamond should fall within certain graded standards.

Lab grown diamonds are created in laboratories under controlled environments just the same way diamonds are formed in nature. They are geologically and chemically the same with the mined ones which means that they exhibit the same appeal, strength and beauty but at a reasonable price.<br><br>

                Diamonds, while exceedingly tough, can also lose their sheen if adequate care is not given to them. Here are a few pointers on how to take care of your diamonds:<br><br>
                <ul class="pt-2 mb-0">
                    <li><strong>Cleaning Diamond Jewellery:</strong> Regular cleaning is important in order to keep your diamond looking its best. To do this, take a clean and soft bristled toothbrush, some warm water and a drop of mild dish soap and clean the diamond jewelry very gently. Do not use any cleaning agents that are too strong as they may damage the stone’s diamond surface.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>Storing Your Jewelry Safely:</strong> In the event you are not wearing the diamond pieces, you can keep them in a soft-lined box to guard them against scratches on the surfaces. Provisions should be made to keep each of them different in order to prevent such strong materials from bumping one another and causing destruction.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>Periodic Inspections:</strong> When active diamond ring wear commences, get the diamond engagement ring setting examined by a professional every few months to check that the stone is not wiggling or falling out.</li><br>

                    <li><strong>Diamond Grading:</strong> The grade of diamond is based on its 4 Cs, and also some specific details such as proportions of the cut and presence of fluorescence.

                    <li><strong>Diamond Value Factors:</strong> In addition to the 4 Cs, there are other diamond value factors such as shape, brand and even certification.
