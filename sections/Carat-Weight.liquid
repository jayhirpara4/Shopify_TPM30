        <h2 class="heading text-start">What is Diamond Carat weight?</h2>
        <div class="GuideHeading text-start">
            A carat weight determines the physical weight of a diamond and does not parametrize its dimension. One carat is 0.2 grams, which is approximately the weight of a standard paper clip. In ‘points’ measurement, one carat also equals 100 points. A 0.50 carats diamond for instance would be 50 points.<br><br>
            
            Carat weight does alter the size of the diamond in relation with other factors such as center diamond cut and shape which will also determine the size of the diamond.

                <div class="aboutDesc">
                    <h3><strong class="f-20 cl-51">1. Appearance:</strong><br></h3>
                    <ul class="m-0">
                        <li>Larger weight categories almost always look good and are able to get all attention focused on them.</li>
                        <li>The cut quality on the other hand, to an extent, affects the visual size and brilliance of the diamond and can make smaller diamonds look bigger and vice versa.</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    
                    <h3><strong class="f-20 cl-51">2. Price:</strong><br></h3>
                    The two cannot be separated because the price of the diamond rises at an exponential rate relating to carat as the size and therefore the rarity increases with the size for instance, a 2.00 ct diamond will fetch a price much higher than the combined price of two 1.00 ct diamonds. Price changes considerably between carat weights.<br><br>
                    
                    <h3><strong class="f-20 cl-51">3. Settings and Style:</strong><br></h3>
                    It is common for larger diamonds to necessitate stronger settings while smaller diamonds are more conducive to complex designs or settings with many small stones that fit together.

                        Carat weight is one of the most destructive parameters on price. To give a more prudent push, one could opt for diamonds, which are a more intelligent purchase, just than the highly popular ones. For instance, a weight of 0.90 rather than the usual 1 carat. These diamonds are nearly the same but cost less price.

                        Certain settings are capable of making smaller diamonds appear larger than would normally be possible. For instance, a halo setting can make a 0.5ct diamond appear like it is closer to 1ct.

                        Wearing larger sized diamonds, for example, is more likely to cause problems such as catching on clothing or discomfort. The weight should be a compromise between the decorative and practical sides.
