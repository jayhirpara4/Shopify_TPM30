        <div class="GuideHeading text-start pt-1">
            The diversity of diamonds is limitless when it comes to their types and cuts in that each one is aesthetically different from the other. Some of the commonly practiced cuts include:
        </div>


        <ul class="pt-2">
            <li><strong>Natural Diamonds:</strong> In its most basic and organic form, this diamond is made over many ages.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Lab-Grown Diamonds:</strong> Similar to the natural ones in appearance and composition but typically cheaper, these diamonds are manufactured in high tech methods in specific settings.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Treated Diamonds:</strong> These are real diamonds which have been artificially changed in color and/or clarity.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Fancy Color Diamonds:</strong> These are beautiful but uncommon diamonds that come in colors such as pink, blue, yellow and green.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Round Brilliant Cut:</strong> This is the most popular cut for engagement rings as it is designed to enhance the sparkle and brilliance of the diamond.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Princess Cut:</strong> This is a square or rectangular cut that is designed to look both modern and elegant at the same time.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Emerald Cut:</strong> This cut is defined by a longer step cut which has the loveliest of faceted edges typical of the retired diamond cuts.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Cushion Cut:</strong> This cut is somewhat rounded while square at the same time with soft edges which provides a romantic touch.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Oval, Marquise, and Pear Cuts:</strong> These cuts all have their uniqueness and characteristic features that tend to enhance the appearance of the diamond even if the carat weight is low.</li><br>
        </ul>

        <div class="GuideHeading text-start pt-1">
            Every diamond cut enhances the elegant beauty of the diamond in its own unique way, and therefore the best cut to go for is a matter of individual taste and the desired effect.

                <div class="aboutDesc">
                    One of the recent applications in the diamond industry is the booming popularity of diamonds that are made in laboratories. Lab diamonds are diamond simulants made in controlled conditions; they are natural diamonds in every sense except for a few advantages.

                <ul class="pt-2">
                    <li><strong>Conscientious Consumerism:</strong> When worn, cultivated diamonds do not pose any health risk as they exert no strain on the environment. This is a great benefit over the traditional diamond which is often mined in a way that comprises assisted labor that is, in many cases, not ethical.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>Affordable Fabricated Diamond Choices:</strong> It is an obvious factor that lab grown diamond is less expensive but it is also for people who want to make eco friendly choices and buy responsibly sourced products.</li>
